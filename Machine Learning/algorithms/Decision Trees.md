- used for classification and regression
- recursively partition the feature space into regions and make predictions based on the majority class (classification) or the average value (regression) of the training instances in each region

# Use Cases
1) Classification (e.g customer segmentation, medical diagnosis)
2) Regression (e.g house price prediction)
3) Anomaly Detection (e.g used to identify outliers or anomolies in data like unusual network traffic)
4) Feature Selection (finding the most important/relevant features in data)
5) Ensemble Learning (base learners in ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradiant Boosting, which combine multiple weak learners to create a stronger one)
