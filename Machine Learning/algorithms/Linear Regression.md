- find the best linear equation to fit the data
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon $$
- Y is what we try to predict (ex. sales)
- X is our feature we use to predict (ex. advertising expenditure)
- $\beta_0, \beta_1$ is what we are trying to fit our model for values that show an as good as possible connection between our input feature and our predicted value
- $\epsilon$ is the error term. Optimally it would be 0 but in reality there always is an error margin that can't be explained only using X. it captures the randomness and unobserved factors affecting Y.  

- Can also use multiple input features 
$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n X_n + \epsilon$$



# Use Case
- Predicting continuous values (e.g., house prices, stock prices)
