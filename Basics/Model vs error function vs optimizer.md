# Model
- mathematical representation or framework
- describes the relationship between variables in a dataset
- simplifying complex relationships and making predictions or inferences
- Purpose: undestand, predict or explain phenomena in the real world
- ex: linear regression, decision trees, neural netowrks, ...

# Error function
- also knows as loss or cost function
- quantifies the difference between the predicted values of the model and the actual observed values in the dataset
- meassures how well the model is performing
- ex: SSE, Cross-Entropy Loss, MAE

# Optimizer
- Algorithm or method used to minimize the error function by adjusting the parameters of the model
- Iteratively updates the model parameters to reduce the error, resulting in more accuracy and effectiveness
- Ex: Gradiant Descent, SGD, Adam Optimizer

# Relationship
- the model defines the structure and mathematical form of the relationship between values
- the error function meassures how good our model is doing by comparing our predicted values with the actual values 
- the optimizer adjusts the parameters of the model to minimize the error
