- ML is a subset of Ai and DL is a subset of ML
- both ML and DL are not using hard coded
- the models recognize patterns in the data and use that to predict results using new data
- ML requires feature engineering (what features are important)
- DL performs automatic feature extraction (less need for manual intervention)
- ML better for smaller datasets and uses smaller computational power
- DL requires larger datasets and often requires fast GPU'S or TPU's
