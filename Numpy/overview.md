- Numerical Python
- fundamental library for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. 
- has a wide range of mathematical functions to efficiently operate on these arrays
- used by many other librarys like pandas, scipy, sk learn 


NumPy provides a rich set of functions for working with matrices and multidimensional arrays. Here's a categorized list of some key functions in NumPy that are commonly used for matrix operations:



The doku here is not finished but there is just too much to cover, refer to the official Numpy Documentation
