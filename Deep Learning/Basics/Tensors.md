- generalization of vectors and matrices to potentially higher dimensions. 
- used by ml libraries like np, tf, pytorch
- **Scalar**: A single number (0-dimensional tensor).
- **Vector**: An array of numbers (1-dimensional tensor).
- **Matrix**: A 2-dimensional array of numbers.
- **Tensor**: A multi-dimensional array of numbers. Tensors can have any number of dimensions (0, 1, 2, 3, ...).

Tensor have
- rank (0-scalar, 1-Vector, ...)
- shape (size of each dimension)
- element type (int, float, ...)
- Tensors support various mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication (element-wise, matrix multiplication), reshaping, slicing, and more
