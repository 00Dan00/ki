- mimic the behavior of biological neurons found in the human brain
- receive one or more inputs, process these inputs using some mathematical operation, and produce an output
## Mathematical Operation
- Each Input to a Neuron is usually associated with a weight, which represents the weight (importance) of that input
- The neuron computes a weighted sum of inputs, which is then passed through an activation function. The activation function introduces non-linearity into the neuron's output, allowing the neural network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data.
## Layers
- Input Layer: The first layer that receives input data
- Hidden Layer: Intermediate layers that process inputs from the input layer or previous hidden layers
- Output Layer: The final layer that produces the output
## Output
- The processed output from each neuron is then passed as input to neurons in the next layer of the neural network
- This process is repeated through multiple layers of neurons (referred to as hidden layers) until a final output is produced by the neural network
